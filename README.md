# üìà NVIDIA (NVDA) Financial and Comparative Stock Analysis

This repository contains a financial analysis of **NVIDIA (NVDA)**, focusing on its stock price performance, valuation metrics (P/E ratio), and market capitalization compared to major benchmarks and peers. The analysis uses historical stock data, S\&P 500 company information, and current financial metrics for a comprehensive view.

The core of this project is a Jupyter Notebook that generates both static and interactive visualizations to explore NVDA's journey from a high-growth tech stock to a major market player.

## üöÄ Key Features

* **Comparative Stock Performance:** Analyze NVDA's price performance since 2020 against the **S\&P 500 (SPY)** and the **Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK)**, with an emphasis on the COVID-19 era.
* **Sector and Peer Valuation:** Compare NVDA's trailing and forward P/E ratios and market capitalization with tech giants **Microsoft (MSFT)** and **Google (GOOG)**.
* **Historical Context:** Visualize NVDA's date of entry into the S\&P 500 compared to the historical entries of all other companies in the index.
* **Interactive Dashboard:** The notebook integrates the `panel` library to create an **interactive dashboard**, allowing users to dynamically adjust parameters like time-frame and histogram bins for a personalized view of the data.

## üìä Sample Visualizations

The analysis includes charts like:

### NVDA Price Performance vs. Market & Sector (2020-Present)
